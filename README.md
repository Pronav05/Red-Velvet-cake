Red velvet cake is a classic American dessert, but it’s becoming more and more popular outside of the US, and for a good reason – it’s so festive and delicious. Although there’s cocoa powder in the recipe, the amount is rather small and the flavor of chocolate is subtle, so it isn’t meant to be a chocolate cake. Actually, the cocoa powder is there mainly to provide a slight red color.
